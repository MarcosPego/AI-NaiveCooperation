# Games Created

This is the repository contains the build and source code to the project Naive Cooperation for a course of the master's degree in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

This project was created for the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems course which aimed to test and understand agent cooperation in a game's environment. 
This project was done by two students and the theme and workings of the agent was free to choose. We decided to go with a platformer with two playing characters, 
a naive character that always aims to reach the goal but is unaware of its surrounding dangers and a protector character that always aims to keep the naive character safe from harm but is unaware of were it wants to go.


## Snapshots

The project was composed of 4 levels that increase in difulty each level. The levels always follow a linear path from the left to the right and can have varying degrees of obstacles and challenges.

The first level is simple, it has no variation in elevation and is composed by a falling block, a saw blade and moving spikes.

The second level has similar obstacles to the first one but has differences of eleveation and even falling pits.

The third one is more complex, it has multiple saw blades on the top of the first half to display that the agents properly understand when some obstacle presents as a danger. 
The next half has three saw blades properly spaced out and finishes with two falling blocks in a row.

The last level was the hardest containing several obstacles and variations of height.
